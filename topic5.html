            <h3>An Air Raid Shelter</h3>
            <p>In September 1939, St George’s Brandon Hill was informed by Bristol Town Council that the crypt was now under possession of the council as an air raid shelter. Subsequently, the St George’s crypt was used between 1939 and 1945 as a shelter during World War II. A second shelter for the local area was established at Brandon Hill. </p>

            <h3>The Blitz, a Lucky Escape</h3>
            <p>On 24th November 1940 Bristol experienced its first Blitz. The raid lasted for six hours and destroyed historic buildings and a quarter of the medieval city. Most of Park Street and the Triangle were also destroyed. Although St George's was hit by a bomb, it miraculously escaped serious damage. The star in the ceiling in the main hall is a reminder of the bomb which hit the church. Unfortunately, the mother church St Augustine-the-less was less lucky and severely damaged during the bombings, so that it had to be closed. <br/>
              <br/>
              Three more bombings of Bristol followed on the 2nd December 1940, 3rd January 1941 and the 16th March 1941 targeting the council house, the docks and the surrounding areas of St George, Easton, Eastville and Fishponds. </p>

            <h3>The Story of the Jeweller</h3>
            <p>Park Street was one of the worst hit areas of the Blitz on 24th November 1940. Whilst the majority of the buildings on Park Street were destroyed, miraculously Mr Chilcott's business, a jeweller, was still standing. The building however was damaged and vulnerable to looting. Hence, a worried Mr Chilcott gathered the most valuable possessions, went to St George's churchyard and buried his treasures. The following day he recovered his 'loot' from the graveyard. </p>
