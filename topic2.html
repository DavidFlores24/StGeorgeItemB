            <h3>The Need for a New Church</h3>
            <p>After the end of the Napoleonic War, the government’s main was to restore social order and increase industrial development.  This drove the working classes into even greater poverty and people lost faith in the Church of England which was regarded as part of the establishment. Indeed, the primary function of the church was to maintain the social order and very few clergy believed in any other higher aims. Pews in the parish churches had to be rented leading to an even greater exclusion of the poor. As a consequence, Methodism (with its famous leader John Wesley) and other dissenting religious nominations attracted new followers. Even secularism was on the rise. <br/>
              <br/>
              The growth of the parish St Augustine caused a significant shortage of suitable space for worshippers and when the government announced a new Church Building Programme in 1818, the Vestry applied for permission to build a new church next to the new burial ground. St Augustine-the-less received a grant of £11,000.00 to build the new Chapel-of-Ease on Brandon Hill. <br/>
              <br/>
              During the consecration of the new church, the Dean emphasised that “it had been a subject of great regret and lamentation to the best friends of the poor, and the admirers of the established religion, that so little accommodation existed in parochial churches for the mass of the people, an evil which an increasing population daily added to. This evil is two-fold, it either drove the people to ignorance and barbarism, and of course debauchery, or drove them to secession.” </p>

            <h3>Church in Gregorian England</h3>
            <p>Unlike today, in Georgian England everybody was presumed to be a member of the Church of England. As a result, parishioners who occupied land or a house in the Parish had to pay a church rate. This rate was used to pay for the upkeep of the church, the provision of a divine service and the salaries for the clergy connected with the church. In addition to the church rate, pews in a church had to be rented and were therefore reserved for the upper classes. The ‘poor’ either had to stand or sit on uncomfortable benches. The division between the rich and the poor was obvious in a Georgian church and the poor could be forgiven for not attending a service which supposedly was for their betterment. <br/>
              <br/>
              The dissatisfaction with the Church of England and the poor provision of seating led to many people seeking alternative forms of religions such as Methodism or Quakerism, commonly known as dissenters. Non-conformist were the first to reject the payment of church rates. In 1836, a central committee was formed fighting for the abolition of church rates. In 1868, the Compulsory Church Rates Abolition Act was passed making church voluntary contributions instead of compulsory ones which had  a significant impact on the finances of local parishes. </p>

            <h3>The Threat of Methodism</h3>
            <p>At St George’s Brandon Hill, a tent was erected three or four times a week where “a party of itinerant Methodists preached to a large multitude of people’. A plot next to burial ground had already been earmarked by Calvinistic Methodists for the purpose of erecting a chapel. In addition, a new chapel had been erected on the corner of Great George Street and Charlotte Street, later known as the Bethesda Chapel by Mr Cowan ‘who seceded from the Church of England’ and used by George Muller for preaching.

              The Vestry of St Augustine-the-less was genuinely concerned that If they could not provide more or free seating for Church of England followers, those people might be tempted away to a ‘dissenting house’, i.e. a Methodist Church, threatening lower church attendance. </p>

            <h3>St Augustine the Less</h3>
            <p>The church of St Augustine-the-less was first mentioned in 1240 and was built for parishioners living around St Augustine Abbey. In 1480, the church was described to be in great disrepair and was therefore heavily restored by adding a west tower, a nave and a chancel. The church was restored again in 1840 when galleries in the aisles were removed and the north porch was re-built entirely. The church was damaged by air raids during World War II and subsequently closed. In July 1956 it was scheduled for demolition and in April 1966 declared to be unsafe which started the demolition process. The site remained vacant for 23 years before the extension to the Royal Hotel was built across the site of the church and the graveyard. </p>
