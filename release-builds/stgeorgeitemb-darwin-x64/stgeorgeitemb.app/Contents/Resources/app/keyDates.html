            <h4>A New Burial Ground</h4>
            <p>On the 26th April in 1819, St Augustine's Parish informed the local community that burials could no longer take place in the churchyard. This was due to a state of overcrowding and therefore only burials in the vaults were accepted excluding the poor. A parish however, was required to provide burial ground for its parishioners. The Vestry therefore thought to buy new land for a burial ground and found a suitable site between Charlotte Street and Great George Street. The land contained seven empty shell of houses which had to be demolished. The site was finally consecrated in September 1823 by the Mayor and the Lord Bishop. </p>

            <h4></h4>
            <p>On 28th September 1823 the Chapel-of-Ease as St George’s was known then was officially consecrated by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, the Dean Lord Somerset, the Reverend S. Seyer (Bishop’s chaplain), the Reverend H. Green (Chancellor) and Reverend J. Carter (Minister). In attendance were also the Lord Mayor, the Sheriff and churchwardens of the Parish St Augustine. 
              
              The Dean chose the Psalm 122 verse 1 for the prayer “I was glad when they said onto me, let us go into the house of the Lord.”  highlighting the importance of the new church for as a place of worship for the poor. 
              
              The Vestry, the Dean and the Bishop celebrated afterwards in the Montague Tavern in Kingsdown which unfortunately did not survive World War II. </p>

          <p>The new parish of St George’s Brandon Hill was characterised by a great difference in wealth. Great George Street, Berkeley Square, Park Street and Charlotte Street were occupied by either wealthy merchants who had benefited from Bristol’s overseas trade or by surgeons working in the Bristol Infirmary. The other parts of the parish, Limekiln Lane, Frogmore Street and Lamb Street were sites of great poverty. An analysis of the historic St George’s burial records have shown that the majority of burials in the churchyard were of people from Limekiln Lane with an average age of just 37! Limekiln Lane (today George Street) was historically the location of the Bristol Glass Works and was later the location for many general labourers. Our burial records have also shown that the parish was badly hit by the two most severe Cholera Epidemics of 1831 and 1848/49. In fact, a medical team visited the affected areas and reported that the parish of St George’s Brandon Hill had the most ‘appalling’ sanitary conditions. </p>

          <h4>The close of the Burial Ground</h4>
          <p>In 1854, a new Act of Parliament was passed which prohibited the "burial of the dead in England in the metropolis" leading to a closure of inner city churchyards. At that time, infectious diseases such as cholera were spreading fast and it was believed that the burial of the dead next to the living was a major contributing factor. In Bristol, this lead to the closure of all inner-city graveyards, including St Augustine's, in 1854. St George's Brandon Hill was required to discontinue burying within 5 yards of the church or the house wall and only one body per grave was permitted. In 1861, St George's churchyard also faced the final closure and burials were no longer permitted. </p>

          <p>A war memorial cross dedicated to the lives lost in World War I was erected on 24th April 1921 in the churchyard of St. Georges, Brandon Hill and dedicated by the Dean of Bristol. The cross, which is of Clipham stone, bears the names of 74 men of the parish who gave their lives in the war, and has cost £165. The memorial service was taken by the Vicar, the Rev. G. W. Pitt, assisted by the Rev. F. T, Baker, and the lesson was read by Dr. E. H. Cook. The Dean gave an address based on the words, "And I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.'' (St. John xii., 32). The Dean emphasised that the cross was a symbol of sacrifice, therefore a fitting memorial to those of whom they were thinking that day.</p>

          <h4>Canon Gay's Tenure</h4>
          <p>Canon Gay commenced his 51-year career as a parish priest in 1824, initially at Winterbourne and since 1930 at St George’s Brandon Hill. He was very much involved in his local parish heading up over 30 organisations as a Chaplain including the Bristol Hippodrome, the Bristol Light Opera Company and the Bristol Amateur Operatic society. As a chaplain for the Hippodrome, he married a German couple who were part of an ensemble at St George’s in January 1939, just short of the outbreak of World War II. During his tenure, he regularly visited his local parish providing pastoral care in schools, hospitals, youth clubs and even two local theatres. He was very much a hands-on priest and loved by the local community. </p>

          <h4>Final Service and Dismantling</h4>
          <p>The last service was held on Sunday, 29th April at 6.30pm at St George’s in the presence of the Lord Mayor. Afterwards a supper was served in the crypt for all the churchwardens. Subsequently, the dismantling of the church began with items being transferred to other local churches under the premise, if St George’s Brandon Hill would ever re-open, then items would be returned. Chandeliers in memory of Canon Gay were sent to All Hollows Church in Easton, the Christmas crib was given to St Mary’s Church in Fishponds and the bell went to Warmley Parish Church. The congregation itself had struggled on for 9 years without a leader yet, it was deeply hurt by the closure of the church with some claiming they will never set foot into an Anglican church ever again. </p>
