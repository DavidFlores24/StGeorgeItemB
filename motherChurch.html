  	<h3>St Augustine The Less </h3>
  		<p>The church of St Augustine-the-less was first mentioned in 1240 and was built for parishioners living around St Augustine Abbey. In 1480, the church was described to be in great disrepair and was therefore heavily restored by adding a west tower, a nave and a chancel. The church was restored again in 1840 when galleries in the aisles were removed and the north porch was re-built entirely. The church was damaged by air raids during World War II and subsequently closed. In July 1956 it was scheduled for demolition and in April 1966 declared to be unsafe which started the demolition process. The site remained vacant for 23 years before the extension to the Royal Hotel was built across the site of the church and the graveyard.
